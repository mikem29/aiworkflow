# AI Website Builder Consulting Recommendations

This note captures additional feature ideas and guardrails tailored to IndieMade's primary audience: predominantly female Etsy makers across generations who would prefer simple language, reassuring guidance, and quick wins over technical configuration. The suggestions layer on top of existing requirements to spark roadmap discussions.

## Audience-Aligned Experience Enhancements
- Offer craft-focused onboarding questionnaires (e.g., "Do you sell jewelry, fiber art, or vintage finds?") that let the assistant preload tone, imagery, and seasonal prompts before any page is created.
- Provide a "story-first" copy style toggle that guides makers to tell their origin, process, and values in plain language, with optional reading-level adjustments and quick alternate versions (friendly, formal, playful).
- Add voice-to-text and photo capture support so less tech-savvy users can speak their ideas or snap booth/workshop photos from mobile, with the assistant translating them into polished blocks.
- Surface accessibility nudges in human language ("Let's add a short caption so shoppers using screen readers feel included") rather than compliance jargon.

## Conversational "Add Page" Vision Flow
- Replace the blank "Add page" action with a three-step wizard: goal selection (launch sale, promote event, tell my story), audience focus (new shoppers, repeat buyers, wholesale), and tone or mood board selection.
- After the wizard, the assistant should narrate its plan aloud or via a friendly summary card ("Here's the vision I have for your new page...") before generating blocks.
- Include a "Show me similar layouts" option that reuses pre-themed IndieMade blocks or popular patterns from existing sites, so editors can approve structures they recognize.

## Block Reuse and Discovery
- Build a "Block Shop" view that curates reusable IndieMade blocks (category grid, testimonial carousel, featured product row) with previews and plain-language descriptions of when to use each.
- Suggest remix ideas that combine existing blocks with new copy ("Let's reuse your Holiday Market gallery and refresh the captions for Mother's Day") to reinforce consistency.
- Tag saved blocks with craft-specific categories and occasions (wedding season, farmers market, holiday gift guide) to make reuse feel relevant to makers' calendars.

## Commerce and Promotion Helpers
- Integrate light Etsy listing sync that pulls top products, recent reviews, or bestseller badges into AI block suggestions without double entry.
- Offer campaign-ready bundles where a page draft also proposes matching newsletter copy, Instagram captions, and printable signage blurbs the maker can download.
- Provide pricing, inventory, and shipping checklists per page type so sellers remember to link to purchase options and mention turnaround times.

## Confidence and Education Features
- Embed quick "Why I chose this" explanations next to AI suggestions so skeptical editors understand the rationale ("Your audience likes behind-the-scenes posts, so I highlighted your studio process").
- Add a "practice mode" sandbox with sample data, letting new users experiment without touching the live site.
- Supply printable or emailable session recaps that summarize what changed, outstanding tasks, and recommended next steps (photography tips, alt text reminders).

## Operational Considerations
- Track sentiment on AI interactions (thumbs up or down, "still confused" prompt) and surface personas that struggle the most, guiding future coaching content.
- Bundle seasonal prompt packs curated by IndieMade staff or community experts that update automatically (e.g., "Holiday Hustle," "Spring Craft Fair Prep").
- Create an "AI concierge" escalation path where complex requests can be marked for human follow-up (designer review, compliance check) directly from the assistant UI.
