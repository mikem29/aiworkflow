Reorganized the requirements docs under the IndieMade hierarchy so everything now lives at `IndieMade/Features/AI Website builder/requirements/…`. Added breadcrumb READMEs (`IndieMade/README.md:1`, `IndieMade/Features/README.md:1`, `IndieMade/Features/AI Website builder/README.md:1`) to explain the structure, and refreshed the requirements overview to call out the new location (`IndieMade/Features/AI Website builder/requirements/README.md:1`). Updated `codex-output.md:1` so the change log reflects the new layout.

Tests not run (documentation-only change).

Next: 1) Update any external links or tooling that assumed the old `requirements/` path. 2) Scrub the requirement content for Drupal-specific language if the intent is to describe IndieMade.
