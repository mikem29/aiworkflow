**Updates**
- Expanded README with media manager roadmap, plugin recommendations, and AI-enabled search guidance to satisfy the new requirement (IndieMade/Features/AI Website builder/README.md:3).
- Broadened Asset Intake requirements to cover the media-library modal, image style workflows, curated plugin stack, rich metadata, and phased Gemini rollout (IndieMade/Features/AI Website builder/requirements/functional_requirements.md:10).
- Added technical guidance for managing image style configuration, exposing media plugins, planning metadata + vector search, and guarding AI captioning/generation (IndieMade/Features/AI Website builder/requirements/technical_considerations.md:17).

**Testing**
- Not run (documentation-only changes).

**Next Steps**
1. Align with Drupal site builders on the recommended plugin stack and confirm Phase II sequencing before implementation.
- Added `consulting_recommendations.md` with audience-aware feature ideas covering onboarding tone, conversational “Add page” flow, block reuse discovery, commerce helpers, trust-building education, and operational follow-ups tailored to non-technical Etsy makers (IndieMade/Features/AI Website builder/requirements/consulting_recommendations.md:1).

Next steps: 1) Review the recommendations with product/design to pick near-term roadmap items. 2) Map each idea to existing requirements to flag dependencies or gaps before implementation.
