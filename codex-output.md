- Updated the block revision requirements so only approved or checkpointed changes persist, ensuring the AI keeps a manageable set of recent revisions it can surface later (`IndieMade/Features/AI Website builder/requirements/ai_block_management_spec.md:12-16`).
- Documented the conversational rollback flow where the assistant reverts the `ai_assistant_html_block` via Drupal revisions and called out the existing CSS rollback guardrails for coordinated restores (`IndieMade/Features/AI Website builder/requirements/ai_block_management_spec.md:16`).

Possible next step: 1) Align the Drupal moderation workflow to enforce the chosen revision cap and editor approval trigger.
