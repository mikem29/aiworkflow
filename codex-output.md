Added a second-generation stylesheet management spec that keeps AI free to author bespoke CSS while detailing sandboxed storage and automated validation guardrails.  
- `IndieMade/Features/AI Website builder/requirements/stylesheet_management_spec_v2.md:1` introduces end-to-end flow for AI CSS drafting, jailed filesystem/database storage choices, parser-based validation, manifest-driven delivery, and phased rollout guidance.

Possible next steps: 1) Review with product/design stakeholders to confirm this replaces the v1 governance model.
