Added a companion requirements note outlining ten Drupal 11-safe interaction libraries the AI block builder can rely on for animations, sliders, parallax, and rollovers.

- `IndieMade/Features/AI Website builder/requirements/ai_block_behavior_libraries.md`:1 documents selection principles and per-library integration notes so each option can be attached through Drupal libraries without jQuery or Node tooling.

Next steps: 1) Review with front-end team to confirm licensing/assets, 2) Update the behavior catalog once final shortlist is approved.
