Added a new `requirements` documentation set describing the AI-assisted Drupal block designer concept.  
- Introduced a navigation stub so contributors can discover the new documentation folder and its structure (`requirements/README.md:1`).  
- Captured the product vision, measurable goals, scope boundaries, and core personas to anchor future solution design (`requirements/product_overview.md:1`).  
- Detailed editor-facing requirements for asset handling, block lifecycle management, assistant interactions, governance, and accessibility checkpoints (`requirements/functional_requirements.md:1`).  
- Outlined the expected Drupal integration patterns, AI orchestration strategy, theming alignment approach, and key risks to resolve before implementation (`requirements/technical_considerations.md:1`).

No tests were run (documentation-only change).

Next steps:
1. Review the requirements with site builders and designers to validate assumptions about workflows and theming constraints.
2. Break the documented needs into prioritized user stories or epics for implementation planning.
